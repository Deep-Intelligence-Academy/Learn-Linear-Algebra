    "A linear system or system of linear equations refers to a collection of linear equations that are expressed using the same set of variables.\n",

    "### Some simple examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have completed this chapter, we will proceed to acquire the skills to solve systems of linear equations with numerous equations and variables (unknowns). To start, though, we'll examine a more recognizable scenario involving a limited number of equations and unknowns. Despite its apparent simplicity, this scenario is sufficiently complex to illustrate fundamental concepts that will inspire our further exploration.\n",

In such situations, we have the option to represent the solution sets of these equations graphically, enabling us to visually observe various patterns or characteristics. First consider only one following equation:\n",

    " - By introducing a second equation, we impose an additional condition on the points, leading to a unique point that satisfies both equations.\n",
    " - When a third equation is added, it introduces a third condition on the points, and as a result, there is no point that satisfies all three equations simultaneously."
