    "Up until now, we have witnessed multiple instances that demonstrate how the reduced row echelon matrix provides a convenient way to describe the solution space of a linear system. In this section, we will utilize this comprehension to draw some general conclusions about how specific characteristics of the reduced row echelon matrix correspond to the properties of the solution space."
