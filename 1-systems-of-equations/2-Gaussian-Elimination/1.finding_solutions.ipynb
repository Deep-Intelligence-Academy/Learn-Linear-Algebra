    "Due to the eventual consideration of systems containing numerous equations and variables, the graphical method mentioned will typically lack utility. Instead, we will opt for an algebraic approach to address this problem and devise a technique for describing the solution sets of linear systems in a general manner."

    "#### Triangular system\n",
    "\n",
    "A triangular system refers to a system of linear equations where the coefficients of the variables form a triangular pattern when written in matrix form. In other words, the matrix representing the system is either lower triangular or upper triangular.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lower triangular system is one in which all the entries above the main diagonal (the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right) are zero. The variables in the system can be solved starting from the top equation and working downwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following lower triangular system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "            z &= 2 \\\\\n",
    "       2y + 4z &= 8 \\\\\n",
    "    x + 2y + 3z &= 6\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An upper triangular system, on the other hand, has all the entries below the main diagonal equal to zero. In this case, the variables can be solved starting from the bottom equation and working upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following upper triangular system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Triangular systems have some desirable properties that make them easier to solve compared to general systems of linear equations. For instance, the solution to a triangular system can be obtained directly by **back substitution**, without the need for more complex methods like matrix inversion or Gaussian elimination."

    "#### Solution space\n",
    "\n",

    "The solution space for these systems is a single point, and the common solution is x = 1 and y = 1. If you substitute these values into either system, you will find that both equations are satisfied.\n",

    "#### Three operations\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce three operations that convert a system of linear equations into a different system of equations with an identical solution space. Our objective is to generate a new system that has the same solutions as the original one and can be described more straightforwardly.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scaling:** We can multiply an equation by a nonzero number. For instance:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   3x - y = 5\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   has the same solution space as:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   2 \\times (3x - y = 5)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   which is equal to:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   6x - 2y = 10\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interchange:** Interchange equations will have no effect on the set of solutions. For example:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\begin{align}\n",
    "       x + 3y &= 10 \\\\\n",
    "       x - y &= 2\n",

    "       x + 3y &= 10\n",
    "    \\end{align}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Replacement:** We can perform a replacement operation by multiplying one equation by a real number and adding it to another equation. This process is referred to as replacement. For example, consider the following system of equations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    2x + 3y &= 10 \\\\\n",
    "    3x - 2y &= 5\n",

    "Next, we proceed with a similar procedure involving the variable $y$. We select an equation that does not contain $x$ (to avoid reintroducing $x$ in the other equations) but does include $y$. By performing the replacement operation, we will eliminate all occurrences of the variable $y$ in all remaining equations. Here, we choose second equation to eliminate $y$ variables in third equation.\n",
