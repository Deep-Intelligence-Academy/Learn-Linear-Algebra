    "\n",
    "A matrix is typically denoted by a capital letter, such as $A$, and its individual elements are represented with subscripts. For example, the element in the i-th row and j-th column of matrix $A$ is denoted as $A_{ij}$.\n",

    "### Augmented matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "When we write a linear system, it is important to maintain a consistent order of variables in each equation. To create an augmented matrix, we disregard the variables and instead focus on recording the numerical data in a rectangular matrix. For example, the given system of equations can be represented by the following **augmented matrix**:\n",
